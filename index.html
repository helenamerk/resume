	<p>Constantly seeking podcast and book suggestions. Living a plant-based life.
		Probably drinking coffee. Advocating for self-improvement and constant
		selflessness. </p>

	<p>I began my studies at Duke University in 2017, studying a
		combination of global health, computer science, and entrepreneurship. My
		perfect major would be an interdisciplinary exploration of how tech entrepreneurship can reduce
		inequities and improve health outcomes.</p>

	<p>Currently, I'm building a company (which keeps me busy), while also working to blog more on
		medium. I enjoy following industry trends in transportation,
		wellness, and education.</p>
