    Constantly seeking podcast and book suggestions. Living a plant-based life.
    Probably drinking coffee. Advocating for self-improvement and constant
    selflessness.

    I began my studies at Duke University in 2017, however decided to leave
    after 3 terms to join a startup in Mountain View. About 9 months later, I
	convinced a friend from school to apply to <a href=https://ycombinator.com>Y Combinator</a> with me. 
	Fastforward almost a year, and here we are building <a href="https://joinglimpse.com">glimpse</a>, on a mission to redefine how we build and maintain relationships online.

  <p>
    Currently, I'm building a company (which keeps me busy), while also working
    to blog more on medium. I enjoy following industry trends in transportation,
    wellness, and education.
